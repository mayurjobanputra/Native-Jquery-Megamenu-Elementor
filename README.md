# A Megamenu for Elementor using ONLY Jquery and CSS and standard Elementor sections and blocks! - Just 30 lines of code!

About this:
Build your Megamenu content directly below your main navigation menu as a native Elementor section. Place your content inside a new section with a custom class ID and then use the provided script.html inside your footer in an HTML block so that it triggers when the page is rendered. 

Requirements:
1. Elementor (free or pro) installed and activated
2. A navigation menu widget (native Elementor widget) added into your page/section/header and displaying your main menu
3. A method to add html to your footer (I use a native footer section that display site-wide via Elementor Theme builder)
4. Basic understanding of CSS and how to DevTools (chrome) to find the unique class id of the main nav menu

How to use:
1. Directly below your main menu, build your submenu in a new section and give it a unique class id (unique per dropdown)
2. Drop the provided script inside your footer in an html block
3. Edit the provided script to reflect your unique css classes
- Line 8, 17, 20, 22 - the custom class ID of the section you build inside Elementor
- Line 16 - the class id of the menu item from your main menu
