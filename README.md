# A Megamenu for Elementor using ONLY Jquery and CSS and standard Elementor sections and blocks!

## NOTE: This isn't working perfectly just yet. See notes below.

How it works:
Build your Megamenu content directly below your main navigation menu. Place your content inside a section and then use the provided script.html inside your footer in an HTML block. 

Requirements:
1. Elementor install and active
2. A navigation menu (native Elementor widget) added into your page/section/header and active
3. Ability to add html to your footer (I use a native footer section on the site built via Elementor)

How to use (youtube coming soon):
1. Directly below your main menu, build your content rich megamenu in a new section
2. Drop the provided script inside your footer in an html block
3. Edit the footer script to reflect your unique css classes

Lines below that you need to edit for your own needs (in the HTML file I provided in this repo):

- Line 8, 17, 20, 22 - the custom class ID of the section you build inside Elementor
- Line 16 - the class id of the menu item from your main menu
